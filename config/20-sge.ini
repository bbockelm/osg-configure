[SGE]
; This section has settings for configuring your CE for a SGE job manager

; The enabled setting indicates whether you want your CE to use a SGE job 
; manager
; valid answers are True or False
enabled = FALSE

; The sge_root setting should give the location of sge install directory
;
sge_root = UNAVAILABLE

; The sge_cell setting should be set to the value of $SGE_CELL for your SGE
; install.
sge_cell = UNAVAILABLE


; The job_contact setting should give the contact string for the jobmanager 
; on this CE (e.g. host.name/jobmanager-sge) 
job_contact = host.name/jobmanager-sge

; The util_contact should give the contact string for the default jobmanager
; on this CE (e.g. host.name/jobmanager)
util_contact = host.name/jobmanager

; This setting is optional and determines whether the SGE SEG module is enabled
; for the SGE job manager. Although using the SEG requires access to your SGE
; log files on your CE, it also substantially reduces the load on your CE and
; SGE scheduler since Globus will be able to monitor job status by examining
; the SGE logs instead of querying the SGE scheduler.
;
; By default, this is disabled
seg_enabled = DEFAULT

; This setting is required if the SEG is enabled. This setting should point
; to the directory with your server log files for your SGE installation so
; that the SEG module can monitor jobs running on your cluster. 
;
; If you enable the SEG, you will need to change this and point it at a valid 
; directory
log_directory = UNAVAILABLE
